       recordings, it is set when starting a new recording
       (i.e., in `RecordViewController.recordTapped`).

    /*  NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF

        `seqUpdater` was used to get the current `seq`uental number
        of the stream's state (i.e., the current user state) because
        sessions and recordings have been handled inside the "person"
        aggregate.

        Since then, sessions and recordings got their own aggregate
        that reference the user they belong to. This means that no
        updater is necessary because

            + sessions `seq`s would be maintained by the respective
              app, and when a session is ended explicitly (hitting the
              "End Session" button for example) then a new session
              will be started.

              When sessions end in an improper way (app is closed via
              forced shutdown etc.), the only difference is that there
              won't be an explicit "session_ended" event generated. This
              is not an issue as both are handled by the `updateSession`
              command and it is mostly just a nicety.

            + At this point (005381aaa0a3eae4dd374103c755ac8c8e1a96b2 + 1,
              that is commit containing this note) recordings are only
              submitted, therefore the emitted event only generates a
              new aggregate instance (or stream) with `seq` always 1.

              Maybe editing will be allowed later or adding extra metadata,
              but that would probably be handled by the app itself.
