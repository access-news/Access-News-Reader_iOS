     recording from this point, seeing the timer updated from there.
     Hence this global variable.

     Updated from `stopRecordTimer` because once recording is
     stopped, if

     * "Continue" (recording) button is pressed, this would init,
     `updateTimerLabel`, called periodically from the timer below.

     * "Play" is tapped, it would be used to restore the timer
     label once returned from the playback UI. (Plus recording
     could be resumed, as described in the previous item.)
